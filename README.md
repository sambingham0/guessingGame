# Overview

As a software engineer, I am constantly looking for ways to improve my coding skills and gain a deeper understanding of programming languages. For this project, I wanted to demonstrate my proficiency in Java by creating a simple number-guessing game. This project allowed me to practice important Java concepts such as loops, conditionals, input validation, and working with file I/O operations.

The "Guess the Number" game challenges the player to guess a randomly generated number within a set number of attempts. The player receives feedback on whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game also tracks the number of attempts it took the player to guess correctly and compares this to previous attempts to track the player's best score.

My goal for this project was not only to build a functional game but also to become more familiar with Java syntax, error handling, and working with files for saving and reading game results.

# Development Environment

I developed this software using the following tools and technologies:

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code
  
# Useful Websites

Here are a few websites that I found helpful during the development of this project:

- [Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [GeeksforGeeks - Java I/O](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-io/)

# Future Work

While this project is functional, there are a few things I plan to improve and add in the future:

- **Add a graphical user interface (GUI)**: Currently, the game is text-based. A GUI would improve the user experience by making the game more visually engaging.
- **Implement difficulty-based rewards**: In addition to tracking the best score, I could offer rewards based on the difficulty level and attempts made.
